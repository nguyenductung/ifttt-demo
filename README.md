# IFTTT DEMO
Demo: [http://ifttt-demo.herokuapp.com](http://ifttt-demo.herokuapp.com)

This project is a simple clone of [ifttt.com](ifttt.com)â€”a web-based service which allows other services (e.g. Facebook, Gmail, Twitter, Instagram) to be programmed by means of simple conditional statements (called "recipes").

Currently, IFTTT DEMO offers some sample recipes:

* If **time is ???** then **post a tweet to Twitter**
* If **user post a photo to Instagram** then **post that photo to Twitter**
* If **user post a photo to Instagram** then **upload that photo to Google Drive**
* If **user post a photo to Twitter** then **upload that photo to Google Drive**

###### To do in next update
* Support more platforms
* Add more recipes
* User can create new recipes
